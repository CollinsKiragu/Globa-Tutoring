				<h3><center>Behavioral Problems</center></h3>
				<p>Behavior problems interrupt the learning environment in the classroom, which affects both teaching and learning.
					Teacher, devise workable rule brokers' ways to stop these behavioral issues.
					No matter how little, a rule is a rule.  </p>
				<p>The top 10 classroom behavior issues and effective solutions are as follows: </p>
				<ol>
					<li>Aggression</li>
						<p>In addition to being a major issue in the classroom, aggressive behavior also interferes with a secure learning environment. </p>
						<p>Even between students, physical altercations can be quite damaging. Both parties may sustain injuries, and they may develop a hatred for one another.
							They can fight in the classroom once more, which will stop all other activities in their tracks.
							It results in adverse impacts on educators and other students.
							These kinds of students act impolitely toward everyone in the school and break the regulations. </p>
					<li>Inappropriate Language</li>
						<p>Some kids speak crudely to their classmates, which has a negative effect on how they develop as people.
							They use crude language in an effort to catch the teacher's attention. </p>
						<p>On the other hand, some children use this language because it is common in their home setting, while others do it to express failure or frustration.
							They don't understand social customs or how to interact with teachers and peers. </p>
					<li>Inattentive Students</li>
						<p>Students who never miss class yet sit in the back to pay less attention in class.
							Students can develop hyperactivity disorder, a lack of attention that makes it difficult for them to manage their conduct. </p>
						<p>These students have trouble completing their academic assignments.
							As a result, they take longer to complete their activities and occasionally struggle to understand the lesson, leading to frustration and tension.
							Teachers should often give these kids more attention. </p>
					<li>Frequent use of the bathroom</li>
						<p>While in class, some students often use the restroom.
							They keep drinking water and then request to use the restroom.
							When a kid asks to use the restroom while the teacher is teaching, there is disruption.
							He will return, and the entire class will have to wait. </p>
						<p>The instructor needs to make bathroom passes.
							Put a cap on how many they can use each day as well.
							Students will be required to learn the rules and regulations of the classroom by completing this. </p>
					<li>Constantly seeking attention</li>
						<p>The majority of the students in the class are misbehaving and unruly.
							They disrupt instruction and make a mess during the entire class.
							causing trouble with other students by stealing pencils, destroying copies, bashing, pinching, and striking, among other things. </p>
						<p>They should be summoned to the front bench by the teacher, who should also address their behavior. </p>
					<li>Overconfident </li>
						<p>Some pupils act arrogantly toward the teacher and create commotion in the classroom.
							They don't care if their behavior disturbs kids or offends professors, and they believe they are capable of handling any situation.
							Their arrogance results in missed chances and poor planning. </p>
					<li>Crying</li>
						<p>Children occasionally cry because they miss their parents without realizing that their tears are disrupting the entire classroom setting.
							Both the teacher and the pupil must wait until it stops sobbing.
							Some people are sobbing as a result of worrying about having a difficult day at school. </p>
						<p>The reserved pupils don't like to read in front of the class.
							They start weeping and cause a commotion when the teacher asks them to read. </p>
					<li>Lateness and leaving</li>
						<p>Some students regularly arrive late, which causes a ruckus in the classroom.
							Since they arrived later, they were unaware of early learning.
							They then give the justification of homework assignments.
							Every day they miss the first period, their grades decline.
							Some students take time off from school for various reasons.
							They excuse symptoms including giddiness, fever, headache, and stomach pain. </p>
					<li>Continuously moving </li>
						<p>Students that move around a lot in class disrupt the learning environment.
							They lack social skills, may be anxious or mentally ill, and have no interest in learning to read or write.
							They make an effort to find a friend who shares their disinterest in academic pursuits. </p>
						<p>We give them several tools to regulate their irritating conduct.
							such as stress relievers or sketchbooks where people can draw to decompress. </p>
					<li>Students who are retentive</li>
						<p>Every class has one student who serves as the monitor, which is advantageous in many ways.
							However, kids develop their independence through classroom duties such as collecting papers, passing out papers, and collecting messages for the office, among many others.
							He or she is unable to properly complete their studies because of these obligations.
							They always have union meetings and other commitments, which hinders their academic success. </p>
				
				</ol>
				
				<h3>How we assist the students:</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Promoting metacognition and self-reflection through organized exercises and tests that link new information with existing knowledge, raise issues, and call for reflection. </li>
					<li>Encouraging a positive learning environment in the course.iLearn alongside and from our students, acknowledging their contributions, and promoting their participation in and input on the course.</li>
					<li>Giving kids the chance to create and put into practice coping mechanisms that support emotional and academic regulation.
						Talking with students on the value of confusion, creativity, risk-taking, and exploring new possibilities and ideas in their learning, as well as the importance of learning from mistakes and failure.
						increasing the use of formative feedback to encourage discussion about learning and provide students chances to clear up any misunderstandings </li>
					<li>Fostering in learners a sense of agency and control over their education.
						Supporting their development of efficient self-regulated learning techniques and offering them a variety of ways to demonstrate their understanding, such as by submitting assessment tasks in various forms, are important. </li>
					<li>Developing and encouraging a feeling of community within the course.
						by setting an example and giving pupils chances to connect and form relationships.
						Structured cooperative learning activities, online or in-person drop-in sessions right before or after class, introductory discussion boards, and chances for casual chat are all effective ways to build familiarity and trust. </li>
				</ol>
				
				<p>It takes time for behavior to change.
					It requires patience and remains linked to our goal.
					The setting in which we teachers prepare the pupils for their future is the classroom.
					A excellent teacher mentors students using discipline, guidelines, and rules.
					We employ a few techniques in the classroom. </p>
